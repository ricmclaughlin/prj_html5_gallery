This project is a walk through of the Animated Image Gallery chapter of [Udemy's Projects in HTML5](https://www.udemy.com/projects-in-html5/learn/#/)

Instead of just using good ole HTML5 Boilerplate, I used the [H5bp generator](https://github.com/h5bp/generator-h5bp#readme) [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator. Unfortunately, this generator does NOT include Sass, a task runner like grunt or gulp OR browsersync.

This gave me a great opportunity to dig into gulp a bit so I could get these HTML5 projects going quickly in the future with the tools that are needed for the job. I implemented [libsass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass) & [browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/gulp/) loosely based on the good guide to starting with gulp by [Andy Carter](http://andy-carter.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-task-runner-gulp).
